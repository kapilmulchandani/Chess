	This is a code for chess game made in C language.
	This is a multiplayer game. 
	A 8x8 Chess board is created.
	The pieces with first letter 'W' are white pieces, and with 'B' are black pieces.
	The Columns are named alphabetically, and rows are named numerically.
	The User has to enter the coordinates of the piece to be moved and the coordinates where he has to move that piece.
	It has all the rules required for playing the game, If someone makes a wrong move, it shows that an invalid move has been made, and asks for another move.
	If the user gives an incorrect move, such as the rook move diagonally, then there is a warning shown that shows INVALID	MOVE and again asks for the input.	
	Also if for white piece the TO Coordinate is also a white piece, it again shows a warning as same colour pieces cannot overlap.
	This is for entertainment purpose only.
